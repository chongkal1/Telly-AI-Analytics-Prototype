      executiveSummary: `December closed out a solid quarter for the content program. Traffic grew 6% month-over-month to 18,420 clicks, driven primarily by strong performance in the AI & Automation cluster which surged 22%. The pipeline held steady at $385K with 11 captured leads, and our ROAS remains exceptionally strong at 385x against a $1,000 monthly Tely.ai investment.\n\nAI visibility continued its upward trajectory — citations grew 15% to 1,840, with ChatGPT and Perplexity accounting for the majority of references. This positions us well heading into Q1 2026.\n\nThe main area of concern is the Technical SEO cluster, which saw a 3% traffic decline. We're also seeing signs of content fatigue in the Link Building cluster. Both warrant attention in January.`,
      trafficAnalysis: `Total clicks reached 18,420 (+6% MoM), with impressions at 412K (+8%). CTR dipped slightly to 4.47% (-2%), likely due to increased impressions from newer content that hasn't yet been optimized for click-through.\n\nThe AI & Automation cluster was the standout performer, growing 22% as interest in AI-powered content strategies continues to surge. SEO content remains the volume leader at 5,240 clicks, while Content Marketing articles showed consistent 12% growth.\n\nNotably, 3 articles published in November are now ranking on page 1 and contributed 2,100 of December's clicks — a healthy sign that the content pipeline is maturing.`,
      aiVisibilityAnalysis: `AI visibility score improved to 54% (+10% MoM), with total citations reaching 1,840 across 6 AI engines. ChatGPT remains our primary citation source (620 citations), followed by Perplexity (440) and Gemini (320).\n\nSentiment scored 78/100, reflecting generally positive framing of our brand in AI-generated responses. The "AI Content Marketing Guide" remains our most-cited page across all engines.\n\nOne emerging trend: Claude citations grew 35% month-over-month, suggesting Anthropic's model is increasingly picking up our technical content. This is worth monitoring.`,
      clusterAnalysis: `The SEO cluster leads in volume (5,240 clicks, 8 pages) with a stable 8% growth rate. Content Marketing follows with strong efficiency — 3,890 clicks across just 6 pages, averaging 648 clicks per article.\n\nAI & Automation is our fastest-growing cluster at 22% MoM, now generating 3,120 clicks. This cluster also has the highest CTR (4.88%), indicating strong topic-market fit.\n\nTechnical SEO (-3%) and Link Building (-5%) are the only declining clusters. Technical SEO content is aging — 2 of 3 pages are 6+ months old and need refreshing. Link Building content faces competitive pressure from newer, more comprehensive guides in the market.`,
      leadsAnalysis: `December captured 11 leads worth $385K in pipeline — a 10% increase in lead volume and 8% pipeline growth. SaaS continues to dominate (5 leads), but we saw encouraging traction from Healthcare (2 leads, $73K pipeline) despite having no industry-specific content.\n\nThree leads converted during the month for a total of $98K in closed ARR. The average deal size increased to $35K from $32K, driven by larger enterprise leads from the FinTech sector.\n\nRB2B visitor identification hit 94 visitors (+12%), with a 11.7% conversion rate from identified to captured. The top referral source remains Google organic (68%), followed by LinkedIn (18%).`,

        'Double down on AI & Automation — fastest growing cluster (22%) with highest CTR. Publish 2-3 new articles on AI SEO trends for Q1.',
        'Improve CTA placement on Link Building articles — strong impressions (18K) but zero lead conversions suggest poor CTA positioning.',

      executiveSummary: `January marked a breakout month for the content program. Traffic surged 16% to 21,340 clicks — our highest monthly total ever — while lead capture jumped 27% to 14 leads representing $462K in pipeline. The ROAS climbed to 462x, up from 385x in December.\n\nContinuing the momentum from December, the AI & Automation cluster accelerated further with 27% growth, and we saw the results of refreshing our Technical SEO content which rebounded to +10% after declining last month. Our investment in content freshness is paying dividends.\n\nAI visibility reached 59% (+9%) with citations crossing 2,200 for the first time. Claude citations continued their surge, now our 4th largest AI referral source. The Healthcare gap we flagged last month produced 2 more leads — reinforcing the case for a dedicated cluster.`,
      trafficAnalysis: `January delivered record traffic: 21,340 clicks (+16% MoM) and 468K impressions (+14%). CTR improved to 4.56% (+2%), indicating that our title and meta description optimizations from the December recommendations are working.\n\nThe SEO cluster drove the volume increase, jumping 14% to 5,980 clicks after we refreshed the "Technical SEO Audit Guide" and published a new pillar page on enterprise SEO strategy. AI & Automation continued its hot streak at 27% growth.\n\nThe biggest wins came from two articles published in late December that reached page 1 rankings within 3 weeks — "AI-Powered Content Strategies for 2026" (1,240 clicks) and the refreshed "Core Web Vitals Guide" (890 clicks). Content velocity from the AI production pipeline is clearly accelerating organic growth.`,
      aiVisibilityAnalysis: `AI visibility score hit 59% (+9% MoM), with 2,240 total citations — a 22% increase. ChatGPT remains dominant at 760 citations, but the real story is Claude's continued rise: 340 citations (+31% MoM), making it our 4th largest AI referral source.\n\nPerplexity showed strong growth at 520 citations, particularly for our technical content. Gemini increased to 380 citations, with a notable preference for our case studies and data-driven articles.\n\nSentiment improved to 80/100 (+2 pts), reflecting consistently positive brand positioning. Our "AI Content Marketing Guide" continues to be the most-cited page across all engines, referenced in approximately 8% of relevant AI-generated responses.`,
      clusterAnalysis: `All 8 clusters showed positive growth in January — a first for the program. SEO maintained its volume leadership (5,980 clicks, +14%), while AI & Automation reached 3,950 clicks (+27%) with a cluster-high 5.20% CTR.\n\nThe Technical SEO turnaround was notable: after declining 3% in December, it rebounded to +10% following our content refresh initiative. Both updated articles are now ranking on page 1 again.\n\nContent Marketing reached 4,350 clicks (+12%) with the best lead generation efficiency — 3 leads from 6 pages. Case Studies grew 15% after we published a new SaaS growth case study that's already generating qualified leads.\n\nLink Building improved 15% and Product Updates surged 28%, though neither cluster has converted leads yet. These remain secondary priorities.`,
      leadsAnalysis: `January's 14 captured leads (+27% MoM) generated $462K in pipeline (+20%). Four leads converted during the month for $181K in ARR — nearly double December's conversion value.\n\nThe lead profile is broadening: while SaaS still leads (6 leads), we saw E-Commerce emerge with 2 leads ($84K pipeline) for the first time. The Healthcare gap we identified in December produced 2 more leads worth $80K, bringing the 2-month total to $153K in pipeline from an industry with zero tailored content.\n\nCost per lead improved to $71, down from $91 in December. The average deal size increased to $33K. Marcus Thompson from ScalePay (FinTech, $52K) and Priya Sharma from HealthBridge (Healthcare, $45K) represent our highest-value January leads.`,

      executiveSummary: `February is on pace to be our strongest month yet. Through the first 15 days, we've already captured 12,680 clicks — projecting to ~25,400 for the full month (+19% pace vs. January). The pipeline has reached $312K mid-month with 9 captured leads, and AI visibility continues climbing.\n\nThe AI & Automation cluster is accelerating even faster, now growing at 32% with a remarkable 5.44% CTR — the highest cluster CTR we've ever recorded. Our January recommendation to expand this cluster is already paying off with 2 new articles contributing 840 clicks.\n\nThe Healthcare investment is validating: 2 more leads ($88K pipeline) from our first Healthcare-focused articles published in late January. Total Healthcare pipeline is now $241K over 3 months from a cluster that's barely a month old.\n\nOne area requiring attention: CTR dipped 2% as new content generates high impressions but hasn't yet been optimized. This is a normal growth pattern we'll address through meta optimization sprints.`,
      trafficAnalysis: `Mid-month traffic stands at 12,680 clicks and 285K impressions, pacing 19% and 22% ahead of January respectively. The trajectory suggests a full-month total of approximately 25,400 clicks — which would be a new record.\n\nAI & Automation continues to dominate growth metrics at 32% MoM, now our second-largest cluster by clicks (2,940). The two new articles — "Automating Content Workflows with AI" and "AI SEO Predictions for 2026" — both published based on January's recommendations and are already in the top 10 pages by clicks.\n\nSEO content grew 18% with the addition of an enterprise SEO strategy guide. Content Marketing is growing steadily at 8%, showing consistency rather than acceleration. Case Studies added a new Healthcare-focused case study that's performing above average.\n\nThe rising tide is lifting all boats: even our smallest clusters (Link Building, Product Updates) are showing positive growth, indicating broad organic momentum.`,
      aiVisibilityAnalysis: `AI visibility reached 62% (+5% over January), with 1,420 citations through mid-month — projecting to ~2,840 for the full month (+27% pace). Claude has now overtaken Gemini as our 3rd largest citation source with 260 citations, confirming the trend we identified in December.\n\nSentiment improved to 82/100, our highest score to date. The improvement correlates with our expanded case study content — AI models tend to cite data-backed content with higher sentiment scores.\n\nPerplexity showed strong growth in citing our AI & Automation content specifically. ChatGPT remains the volume leader but its share is decreasing as other engines grow faster. This diversification is healthy — it reduces dependency on any single AI platform.`,
      clusterAnalysis: `The cluster picture is increasingly clear: AI & Automation is our growth engine (32% MoM, 5.44% CTR), SEO is our volume anchor (18% growth, 3,580 clicks), and Content Marketing is our conversion workhorse (8% growth but highest lead efficiency).\n\nThe new Healthcare content is already appearing in cluster performance — though categorized within existing clusters, the Healthcare case study and early cluster content are pulling in relevant traffic and leads.\n\nTechnical SEO continues its recovery at +6%, maintaining the gains from January's refresh cycle. We should plan another refresh pass in Q2 to sustain momentum.\n\nProduct Updates surged 10% after publishing a feature comparison post. While this cluster isn't a lead driver, it supports mid-funnel prospects evaluating solutions.`,
      leadsAnalysis: `Nine leads captured through February 15, putting us on pace for 18+ leads by month end — a potential 29% increase over January. Pipeline is at $312K mid-month, projecting to $620K+ for the full month.\n\nThe industry mix is the most diverse we've seen: SaaS (3), Healthcare (2), FinTech (1), E-Commerce (1), DevTools (1), and Cybersecurity (1). This diversification reduces concentration risk and validates our content expansion strategy.\n\nThe Healthcare cluster, now just weeks old, has already generated its second month of leads. Jennifer Walsh from MedCore AI ($48K, qualified) discovered our new "Healthcare Content Marketing Playbook" through Google and spent 12 minutes on-site before requesting a demo.\n\nCost per lead increased to $111 mid-month, but this is an artifact of the half-month calculation — projected full-month CPL is $56, our best ever.`,
